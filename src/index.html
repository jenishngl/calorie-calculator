                <h3>What is Maintenance Calorie Calculator?</h3>
                <p>
                    A maintenance calorie calculator is a tool used to estimate the number of calories a person needs to consume in order to maintain their current weight. This calculation takes into account a person's age, gender, height, weight, and activity level.<br><br>
    The basic principle behind a maintenance calorie calculator is that the number of calories a person consumes should match the number of calories they burn. If a person consumes more calories than they burn, they will gain weight, and if they consume fewer calories than they burn, they will lose weight.<br><br>
    It's important to note that a maintenance calorie calculator is only an estimate, and it may not be accurate for everyone. Factors such as metabolism, genetics, and medical conditions can all affect a person's calorie needs.<br><br>
    Additionally, a maintenance calorie calculator should be used as a starting point for a person's dietary plan, not as the sole determinant. Other factors such as nutrient composition, food quality, and meal timing can all play a role in achieving optimal health and weight management.

                <p>
                    Calories are a unit of measurement for energy. The calories in the food we eat provide us with the energy we need to function throughout the day. Every person requires a different amount of calories depending on various factors such as age, gender, weight, height, and activity level.

                    To calculate your daily calorie needs, you need to consider various factors, such as:

                        <h4>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Your BMR is the amount of energy your body requires to perform basic functions such as breathing, circulation, and cellular growth. It's affected by your age, gender, height, and weight.<br><br>
                            The formula to calculate your BMR is:<br>
                            <pre>BMR = 10 x weight(kg) + 6.25 x height(cm) - 5 x age(y) + 5 (for men)<br>BMR = 10 x weight(kg) + 6.25 x height(cm) - 5 x age(y) -161 (for women)</pre>

                        <h4>Physical Activity Level (PAL)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Your PAL is the amount of energy you burn through physical activities such as exercise, work, or leisure activities. It's expressed as a value that ranges from 1.2 (sedentary) to 2.5 (very active).

                        <h4>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Your TDEE is the total number of calories you burn in a day, including your BMR and PAL. You can calculate your TDEE by multiplying your BMR by your PAL.
                        </p>
                        <pre>TDEE = BMR x PAL</pre>

                <h3>Calorie Intake for Weight Loss or Gain</h3>
                <p>To lose or gain weight, you need to adjust your calorie intake. To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your TDEE. To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than your TDEE.</p>
